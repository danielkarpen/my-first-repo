### Javascript Student at Claim Academy

I am currently learning how to code in Javascript at Claim Academy. I have dabbled with HTML/CSS a bit, but want to take my skills to the next level with Javascript and REACT!

Some of my other skills/hobbies are:
1. **_Music_**
    1. Producing beats in Ableton Live
    2. Writing lyrics
    3. Singing/Rapping(not seriously mostly for fun!)

2. **_Video_**
    1. Filming videos with my Sony A6000 Mirrorless Camera
    2. Editing footage in Adobe Premeire Pro and Adobe After Effects

3. **_Design_**
    1. Logos with various online picture editing tools and Adobe Illustrator
    2. Funny T-shirt designs using the same tools I use for Logos

[Some of the music I have worked on can be found here on SoundCloud!](https://soundcloud.com/hirollers-1)

This is how you declare a variable: `const x = 3`

```javascript
const x = 3;
console.log(x + 100)
```
```markdown
# This is a Heading
